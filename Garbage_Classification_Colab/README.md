# Garbage_Classification_Colab
The growing issue of waste management has emphasized the need for efficient garbage segregation to facilitate recycling and reduce landfill waste. This study explores the use of deep learning techniques to automate garbage classification, streamlining the process of separating waste materials for more effective management. We applied two state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks—AlexNet and EfficientNetV2-B1—to classify various types of waste, comparing their performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Both models were trained and tested on a labeled dataset of garbage images, with preprocessing steps applied to ensure data consistency and quality. While AlexNet achieved reasonable accuracy, our findings indicate that EfficientNetV2-B1 outperformed it, achieving higher accuracy and a more robust classification performance. This result highlights EfficientNetV2-B1's potential in real-world applications for automated waste segregation. Our research underscores the value of employing advanced deep learning architectures in environmental technology and suggests future directions for refining model accuracy and scalability for deployment in waste management systems.
