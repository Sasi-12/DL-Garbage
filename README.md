# 🗑️ DL-Garbage - Deep Learning Based Garbage Classification

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify garbage images into appropriate categories. It's designed to support smart waste management by enabling automated sorting of garbage through image classification.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Automatically classify garbage into categories such as **organic**, **recyclable**, **metal**, **plastic**, etc.
- Build and train a **deep learning model** using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix.
- Enable future deployment for real-time garbage detection using camera feeds or mobile apps.

## 🧠 Model Overview

- **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Frameworks Used**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Input**: Garbage image (resized & normalized)
- **Output**: Predicted category label (e.g., paper, plastic, metal)
